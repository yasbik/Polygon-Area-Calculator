# Polygon Area Calculator

This project uses Object Oriented Programming to calcutate the area and perimieter of quadrilaterals. 

The user can create a quadrilaterl (for example a square or a rectangle) and set the dimentions of the shape. The program would the area, perimier, length of diagonal, etc. The program also draws the shape using *'s, and can calculate how many of one shape can fit onto another.
